# **ObjectOrientedProgrammingBasics**
This project shows to principles of OOP and how they are achieved.

### Encapsulation
The binding of an object state and behaviour together into a single unit. 
### Inheritance
Where code is organised though class hierarchies. Refers to an object gaining all the properties from a parent class.
This provides code re-usability.
### Polymorphism
The ability of an object or function to take many forms. Achieved my either using, method overriding or method overloading.
- #### Method Overriding/Runtime
    When the subclass has the same method as declared in the parent class. Used to provide a specific implementation of
    a method. Must have inheritance.
- #### Method Overloading/Compile
    Having multiple methods using the same name but have different parameters. Increasing readability.
### Abstraction
A concept that hides internal details of an application, showing only the functionality.
This is achieved through the process of using abstract classes and interfaces.
